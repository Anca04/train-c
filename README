I implemented the train through a structure, where I included the sentinel and 
the mecanic. I have defined the structures for the queue and the stack as well.
I have implemented the initialization, node insertion and move functions, 
respecting the related requirements. For the write function, I extract the 
symbols with strtok and put them one after one in an array of type char, and I 
did the same for the strings from the search functions. I also implemented the 
functions of deleting the current node and deleting the list, the list returning
to its initial form, in this case. I also added display functions. For the queue 
and the stack, I have implemented the functions of adding commands, deleting the 
first or last element, testing if they are empty. I reverse the queue with the 
help of a stack. I make sure during the entire program that the mecanic is in 
the correct position. I use an interger(position) to retain the position of the 
mecanic. In main, I read from file and write in an output file. I also read the 
commands and execute the ones which should not be put in the queue. 
I obtained 96 points on the tests.
